# Breast-Cancer-Detection-Project
## Classification Project:
To detect whether a person's cancer is Benign or Malignant

## Models Used:
Logistic Regression (Best) & Random Forest

## Main Highlights:
• Used Standard Scaler for Feature Scaling in Logistic Regression.

• Used Cross-Validation Score/Accuracy to pick the best model, which was Logistic Regression with an accuracy of 97.81 %

• Did "Hyper Parameter Tuning" using "Randomized Search" to find the best parameters for Logistic Regression, which gave the cross-validation Score of 98.24 %

• Best parameters were {'solver': 'newton-cg', 'penalty': 'l2', 'C': 0.5}
